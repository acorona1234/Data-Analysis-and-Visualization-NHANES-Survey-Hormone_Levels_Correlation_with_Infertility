# NHANES Survey Analysis
## Hormone Levels and Infertility

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The NHANES Sex Steroid Hormone and Reproductive Health data is a subset of the NHANES data that focuses on the reproductive health of adults.

The data includes measurements of sex steroid hormones such as testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin, as well as information on reproductive health outcomes such as menstrual cycles, fertility, and contraceptive use. The dataset is based on a sample of non-pregnant women aged 20-39 and men aged 20-59.

In addition to hormone levels and reproductive health outcomes, the dataset includes demographic information such as age, race/ethnicity, and education level, as well as behavioral information such as smoking status and physical activity level.
